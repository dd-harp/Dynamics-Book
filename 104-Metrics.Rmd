*** 

If we want to manage malaria, we must be able to measure it. 

## Malaria Epidemiology  

### Infection Prevalence

+ Parasite Rate 

### Infection Incidence 

+ Infection vs. Disease 

### Disease 

### Serology  


## Entomology  

### Entomological Inoculation Rates

+ HBR

+ SR 

+ EIR 

### Bionomics  

## Transmission 

### Infectiousness

### Vectorial Capacity  

### Transmission Efficiency

## Surveillance
