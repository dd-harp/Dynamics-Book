The Ross-Macdonald model is a good way to convey of the basic features of malaria epidemiology. The model is useful in the classroom, and it can help to inform our basic understanding of malaria. If we want to use the model to answer some policy questions, we will soon find that the model has some limitations.  

but this book is about how we want to use the models for other purposes. 

There are many reasons why we would not want to rely on the Ross-Macdonald model to simulate malaria for policies.  

If we want to scale up simulation-based analytics to support malaria policy through eradication, it will inevitably involve capacity building, but what sort of training is needed? Certainly, we hope that an analytics team would include someone who has the skills required to critically evaluate models, but this is not as easy as you think. What makes a model good? What makes an analysis useful? It is easy to imagine training up a generation who could do some kind of analysis, but we don't want to train automata -- people who would keep doing some analysis, over and over, just because it is what has been done before.  We ought to have a reason for doing the analysis. It ought to serve some purpose. Success in policy analytics requires people who have skills in thinking creatively and critically to solve problems. We need people who can build and evaluate models. 

If we want to discuss the models we might use to analyze malaria policies, and if we want to have a discussion about that process, it will probably help us to be more careful about how we use terms like *model* and *model building.* In the service of defining the skill sets required to be a good analyst, this chapter discusses the life-cycle of a model, including the process of building and evaluating models from the beginning to the end (or in math from $\alpha$ to $\omega$). 

## Compartment Models

## Primary Model Development

Most models started with a question: something like _Why is the sky blue?_ or _How many mosquitoes does it take to sustain malaria transmission?_ Blue sky questions don't go anywhere unless there's a basis for understanding the underlying process. If there is some kind of basis, the next step is to try represent the process in some logically compelling form, such as a diagram with boxes and arrows.
