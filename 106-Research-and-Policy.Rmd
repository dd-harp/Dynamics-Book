What makes a model good? Fit for purpose? 

*** 

Macdonald's model was put to the test in a field trial, conducted from September 1966 through February 1969 in the southern part of the Kankiya District of the Katsina Emirate in the North Central State of Nigeria [@NajeraJA1974CriticalReview]. A major conclusion was that there were major discrepancies that were *...in a considerable part due to the deficiencies of the model.*  

Some of those discrepancies were addressed through the development of a new model developed for a new field trial that was conducted in Garki, Nigeria [@DietzK1974GarkiModel].
