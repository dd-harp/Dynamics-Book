# Mosquito Population Dynamics 

There are some very good reasons to care about mosquito ecology, particularly when it comes to vector control [@BradyOJ2015AdultVector]. In this chapter, we fully define a model for mosquito ecology [@SmithDL2013_LarvalDynamics]. The process is actually quite simple:

+ We define terms that describe egg-laying by adult mosquitoes; 

+ We write a basic equation that determines how eggs develop in
aquatic habitats and then emerge as adults; 

+ We incorporate seasonality into parameters in an aquatic model; 

+ We replace the parameter $\Lambda(t)$ from the Aron-May model with a term that
describes emergence of adults from aquatic habitats.

## Aquatic Dynamics 

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rl}
\frac{dL}{dt} &= \eta - (\psi + \phi + \theta L) L \\ 
\frac{dM}{dt} &= \Lambda - g M\\  \\ \hline 
\Lambda &= \frac{\psi L}{2} \\ 
\eta &= \chi \nu M \\ 
\end{array}
\end{equation}
