# Malaria Metrics 

*The metrics commonly used in research and surveillence to measure malaria in populations.* 

*** 

If we want to manage malaria, we must be able to measure it. Models are approximations. We make a distinction between biological processes and observational processes. 

***

Note: in [Measuring Malaria for Control] we revisit the malaria metrics in the context of monitoring and evaluation for malaria control programs. Also see [@HaySI2008MeasuringMalaria] for a general overview of malaria metrics,  [@SmithDL2009MeasuringMalaria] and [@TustingLS2014MeasuringChanges]

## Malaria Epidemiology
