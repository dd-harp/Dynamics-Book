[["dynamics-for-policy.html", "1 Dynamics for Policy", " 1 Dynamics for Policy Malaria is complex and heterogeneous, which makes it difficult to study and manage. A core challenge in both science and policy is the availability of information. Mathematical models can help us understand and analyze all that complexity and make informed decisions despite the data gaps. In basic research, we develop mechanistic models to understand malaria as a biological process. In malaria epidemiology, the states and parameters describe infection, immunity, infectiousness, disease, and drug taking in response to exposure. Scientists focus on basic biological mechanisms in order to understand differences in malaria across spectrum of transmission. Immunity and drug-taking are important factors to consider, but it may be that differences in epidemiology and disease across settings arise from differences in the local parasite populations. The models are a way of summarizing knowledge in a quantitative form – something like a complex hypothesis. A test of a model’s adequacy is whether it can describe malaria accurately after accounting for differences in drug taking patterns and pattern of exposure. We study mosquito ecology and blood feeding to understand malaria transmission and develop theory for malaria control. Transmission models couple parasite infection dynamics in humans and mosquitoes through blood feeding. Mosquito populations are shaped by the aquatic habitats for immature mosquito populations – standing water bodies shaped by topography, hydrology, land use, and the water chemistry shaped by surrounding rocks, soils, vegetation and pollution. These habitats are filled (exogenously forced) by rainfall and after some eggs are laid, the mosquito dynamics are affected by crowding, predation, and other endogenous dynamics. Larval development and parasite development rates are modified by temperature. Adult mosquito activity rates are affected by temperature and relative humidity. Indoor residual spraying kills mosquitoes when they rest on a sprayed surface, usually after blood feeding or during the process of searching for a host. Insecticide treated nets protect humans from biting and kill some mosquitoes. By reducing the availability of potential blood hosts, nets can slow blood feeding in some contexts. Larval source management reduces immature population densities. By studying mosquito ecology and malaria transmission dynamics, we can start to understand malaria as a changing baseline that has been modified by malaria control. This is the problem confronted daily in malaria programs, but it requires a synthesis. The models help translate evidence into information that can be used to make decisions, to make strategic plans, and to mark progress against strategic plans. The models encapsulate information about transmission in context, so it is possible to study how malaria persists in a place over time, and how various factors have modified (or could modify) mosquito population dynamics and blood feeding and thereby suppress transmission. Transmission models help us to set intervention coverage targets based on thresholds. In policy, we use these models with the expectation that – if we fit the models by adjusting parameters that affect how malaria works in some particular place – they should help us understand transmission in some particular context and make good decisions about what to do. Frustratingly, the heterogeneity and the complexity conspire against us. We would like to be sure about how malaria works across settings before we start using the models to stratify populations, tailor interventions to context, or targeting the interventions. Instead, we must admit that we don’t know everything we’d like to, and we probably never will. We must proceed with policy without having satisfactory answers to some basic questions. The models make it possible to fill in the gaps in various ways and evaluate the consequences of having missing data, to assess what missing data would have the biggest effect on malaria, and (ideally) to find a way of filling critical knowledge gaps. To understand malaria or to give policy advice, we must start simple and then add complexity, layer on layer. To deal with missing information, we start with generic models, and then add details to address concerns about some of the details that we hope to identify by studying the systems as we intervene. This approach – starting simple and then layering on complexity – makes it possible to learn as we go. A question is when it stops making sense to add realism to a model. A model that it too simple and abstract might help us understand the basic dynamics and give generic advice, but we would question the model’s adequacy if it can not reproduce the patterns we care about in some particular place at some particular time. As a rule of thumb, a model should be just complex enough to describe the patterns we care about and give advice. Practically speaking, it’s hard to know you’ve gone far enough unless, at some point, it’s clear that you’ve gone a bit too far. Over the past few years, we developed a new framework for building models that would make it possible to start simple and then build models of malaria transmission at any level of complexity. We wanted to be able to build in realism by adding complexity one feature at a time. Through this process we can create nested, hierarchical models in branching chains. At the ends of the chains, we might find highly realistic models that are, perhaps, overfit. (The cautions against overfitting play out differently if you must act now but also could go out and collect new data.) We call the framework’s ability to do this scalability and the resulting swarms have scalable complexity. To make this possible, we needed modular software with plug-and-play functionality and a high degree of structural flexibility. We needed the framework to be extensible. After making a lot of mistakes, the primary design phase is over, and the algorithms have been published in two software packages. We are currently extending the library of base models, which includes some simple or classical models that are instructive or of historical interest. We are also fine-tuning the design requirements for models as we develop protocols that streamline fitting models to data. The software avoids the mistakes we made over the past few years, reuses models, and streamlines the model building process. We hope this software has dramatically lowered the costs of building and analyzing these complex, realistic models. A schematic diagram of the elements in the framework (top half) and the process of model building and model fitting (bottom half) This book has been written to introduce the features of the framework (see Figure 1.1). The book itself is embedded in the RAMP-Model-Library, which was set up during the primary design phase. The RAMP-Model-Library is where we made all our design mistakes: was the software truly plug-and-play, and was the framework truly extensible? As the primary design phase came to a close, the library that was once the laboratory became a classroom and a museum. The library is being transformed into a resource for any developer who wants to add new base models to the library or add functionality. Most of all, it is being set up for the end user, someone in a malaria program or working with a malaria program who wants to use simulation based analytics to analyze policies. This book is structured into a set of lessons that teach concepts. Some of the concepts build on one another, and others take on new challenges. We combine these lessons into some examples where we show some algorithms to build models fit for purpose. When a topic deserves a deeper dive, we have supplemented this book with vignettes or lessons. In malaria epidemiology (narrowly defined as a study of infection and disease in humans), the relationship between exposure, infection, immunity, disease, and infectiousness changes in populations as they age, and it is affected by drug taking. This picture grows more complex as we consider intervening with vaccines or monoclonal antibodies, or as we look at interactions with anemia, nutritional status, and human genetics. Our models need to interface with data from clinical settings and research, so they will need to consider diagnostics, parasite counts, detection, and transmission. Combining these factors can give rise to an overwhelming amount of complexity. We have developed some new models that manage the complexity. While these models are suitable for computation, we still need to understand and explain some of the basic relationships. We are interested in using these models to guide policy, which requires both solid computation and good communication. In this book, we lay a foundation for understanding the complexity by studying some simple compartmental models. We will review classical queuing models for superinfection and the multiplicity of infection (MoI); new models for the age of infection (AoI) or stage of infection (SoI); immunity; parasite densities, fever, disease, and detection; gametocytes and transmission, and drug taking. To end up with models that can handle all the complexity, we build probabilistic models that combine these factors. In doing so, we find that we can do some powerful analysis, and we can map the states in these models onto outcomes that matter for research and policy: test positivity, parasite counts, infectiousness, and disease. With patience, we can combine these factors and develop a framework for understanding malaria in populations that match the features of individual-based simulation models. We end up with a sensible understanding malaria epidemiology as ontogeny – development of immunity as a part of an organisms history. We back this view with some very usable models that capture the changing character of malaria in cohorts of humans as they age. We are interested in understanding malaria control in context, which requires delving into mosquito ecology and behavior. In this book, we start with a simple model for mosquito ecology and parasite infection dynamics in mosquitoes. We add aquatic population dynamics, mosquito population regulation, and exogenous forcing by weather. Later, we worry about adult mosquito behavioral states such as mating, sugar feeding, and egg laying. We introduce the concept of resource availability, and we develop an understanding of mosquito search and movement in response to resource availability. We take some deep dives to understand how mosquito spatial dynamics work at a fine spatial grain, and then we scale up to understand mosquito populations on landscapes. At first, we describe mosquito blood feeding and transmission with a few simple parameters. Later, we develop a new model for mosquito blood feeding in a dynamically changing host population with parameters that allow host strata to be more or less available. We also modify our understanding of heterogeneous exposure to biting. We develop a methods for modeling environmental heterogeneity, heterogeneous exposure by age, and a generalized way of handling failty– other sources of heterogeneous biting – through stratification. We must take a detour to understand how to handle the effects of temperature on the parasite’s extrinsic incubation period (EIP). We need a way of dealing with mosquito survival and dispersal through the EIP. This problem has been effectively solved. To round out this picture, we need a way of dealing with other aspects of human ecology that affect malaria transmission dynamics, including human mobility, human demography, bed net usage, adherance to drugs, and care seeking. Differences among humans call for a synthesis of studies that have identified traits that affect malaria, stratification, and simulation to identify useful ways of propagating the heterogeneity through analyses. To go along with a theory of transmission, we need a theory of control. We compute effect sizes and evaluate area effects. We develop a generalized concept of effect modification that considers the total effect of a single unit of control. We modify basic processes by including the effects of vector control and mass medical interventions (e.g. seasonal malaria chemoprotection, mass drug administration, vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies). Relying on behavioral state models and the concept of resource availability, we develop a models for integrated vector control. In doing all this, we are building on an enormous body of work that started with Ronald Ross. While Ross is better known for identifying malaria parasites in a mosquito gut, which proved that malaria is mosquito transmitted, we are more interested in the academic work that followed. After winning the Nobel Prize in 1902, Ross was instrumental in building solid quantitative foundations for malaria transmission and its measurement. Ronald Ross wrote the first models describing malaria transmission. In his writings from 1899 to 1908, it’s clear that he was searching for quantitative way of saying something simple – if there are not enough mosquitoes, the malaria transmission can’t be sustained. There must be a critical mosquito density, above the cutoff malaria transmission would be sustained, and below it malaria would be eliminated. Ross was looking for a formula that encapsulated his intuition: how were thresholds related to the fact that it took two bites for a mosquito to complete its life cycle? Eventually, Ross wrote down some systems of equations that would describe malaria. The ideas, mathematics, and identification of parameters and processes were extended by other scientists later, most notably Alfred Lotka and George Macdonald. It seems that the challenge of malaria control was what pushed Ross toward modeling. Ross’s first model was a discussion of adult mosquito movement to guide larval source management [1]. The first model describing malaria transmission appeared in a book, The Prevention of Malaria in Mauritius [2]. When it came to thinking through control, Ross found it useful to do the math. This is a book about how to do the math that is required for malaria programs. The goal is to use all the data available, but especially the data generated by malaria programs, to paint a clear picture of malaria transmission as a changing baseline that has been modified by control. The software is structured into three major domains: the humans and malaria epidemiology, including the effects of treating malaria with drugs; the mosquitoes and the way they have been changed by weather and vector control; and parasite transmission through mosquito blood feeding. Within each domain, there are multiple sub-domains, and there are built in ports and junctions to deal with heterogeneity and other features for malaria control. After a 140 years of studying malaria, there’s a lot of detail that could be important in some way. Part of what we need to do is sort through all that detail to find what is most relevant. We have organized the concepts in this book around a narrative that allows us to introduce the core concepts – those that make modular computation possible – in an order that minimizes the need to draw on unfamiliar concepts. We start with the Ross-Maconald model, but our next task is to update the model for mosquito blood feeding. Our philosophy has been to design a framework for model building that can be used by programs. The material in this book is designed to be used by non-experts too, so in this context, model building means applying a set of tools to to computational tasks we wish our brains could do. The software we have developed is meant to lower the costs of building and using models. We want programs to be focused on the decisions, the data, the concepts, and the analysis. As a metaphor, some students learn a numerical method for approximating \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) in school, but after learning it once, they stop worrying about how it is computed and they punch buttons into a calculator. Knowing how to compute something is sometimes useful, but worrying about how to compute it each time would interrupt the process that called for computing it. Instead, we punch the formula into a scientific calculator or any software that does computation confident that the machine knows how to do it. In applying models, the same kind of logic applies. People need to understand the concepts, but like a calculator, the tools should hide the technical details that don’t add to a discussion. The software we have developed is a reliable interface for calculations designed to support policy. To lean how to use that software, we need to get through a lot of material. The background material in the following presentation is fairly sparse. We are trying to introduce just enough mathematics to teach users the critical concepts so they know what the software can do. We assume that the work will be done by teams that include a few people who understand the mathematics, who can guide others through the process. To fill in some of the gaps and technical, we have written (or can write) vignettes. On occasion, the text includes links to these vignettes for those who might find them useful. Please send suggestions about new vignettes to smitdave@gmail.com. The first model we present is a Ross-Macdonald model.
