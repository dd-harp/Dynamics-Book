[["the-ross-macdonald-model.html", "2 The Ross-Macdonald Model", " 2 The Ross-Macdonald Model The development of the Ross-Macdonald model has been discussed elsewhere [1]. There is not a single paper where a system of equations was published by Macdonald. Instead, the model traces back to several different publications that present equations and formulas describing malaria transmission. We have already mentioned that Ronald Ross published two models of malaria transmission, but we also owe a lot to Alfred Lotka, who analyzed both models. Ross’s first model described malaria transmission dynamics using difference equations [2]. That model was reviewed, analyzed, and critiqued first by H. Waite in 1910, [3]. The formulation is a bit hard to follow, so we will present a system of difference equations in place of the equations Ross actually wrote down. Lotka Ross’s second model was thoroughly analyzed by Lotka, who had taken an active interest in Ross’s malaria models. In 1912, he published a set of solutions to Ross’s equations [4]. In 1923, Lotka published an analysis of both of Ross’s models in five parts. The first two parts reformulate Ross’s models [5,6]. The third part tackles numerical issues, which includes a photograph of a clay model of the phase plane as a surface [7], and the fifth part is a concise summary [8]. In the \\(4^{th}\\), which was led by Sharpe, a new model was introduced that included delays for the latent periods [9]. Macdonaald Macdonald made several important contributions to the mathematical study of malaria. Ross’s original formulation remained the standard until Macdonald’s paper on the sporozoite rate [10]. Because of it’s historical interest, we’ll discuss Ross’s formulation in the discussion of Macdonald’s Model, in part, to make it clear why Macdonald’s contribution was significant enough to get his name attached. In the 1950s, George Macdonald published a set of papers describing malaria transmission dynamics and control, culminating in publicataion of a book The Epidemiology and Control of Malaria [11]. In 1950, Macdonald published a new model with human malaria superinfection [12] and a synthetic review of malaria epidemiology [13]. In 1952, Macdonald published a synthetic review of medical entomology [10] and introduced the concept of a basic reproductive number, \\(R_0\\) [14]. As a side note, it’s highly likely that Macdonald was aware of Lotka’s demographic concept of \\(R_0\\), as well as his work with Sharpe on delay differential equations [9], though we have been unable to find a single line where Macdonald gives Lotka the credit. For these reasons, and others, the equations ought to be described as the Ross-Lotka-Macdonald model. References "],["difference-equations.html", "2.1 Difference Equations", " 2.1 Difference Equations Ross had measured malaria prevalence in different populations, and he knew that the level of prevalence was related to mosquito populations. He recognized that prevalence could change, and that what set its value was a balance between two processes. The logic looks like this: \\[ \\left[ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\mbox{Fraction Infected Today} &amp;=&amp; \\mbox{Fraction Infected Yesterday} \\;\\; -\\\\ &amp;&amp; \\mbox{Cleared Infections} \\;\\; + \\\\ &amp;&amp; \\mbox{Fraction Uninfected that Got Infected}\\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\] This description ignores infected people who died, infected people who emigrated, and infected people who immigrated. It’s not perfect, but it’s a starting point. For mosquitoes, we assume they are much more likely to die than to clear infections. So we the process is slightly different: \\[ \\left[ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\mbox{Fraction Infected Today} &amp;=&amp; \\mbox{Fraction Infected that Survived} \\;\\; -\\\\ &amp;&amp; \\mbox{Fraction Uninfected that Got Infected}\\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\] What’s important here is that infectious mosquitoes are infecting people when they bite, and infectious people are infecting mosquitoes when the mosquito blood feeds. This process is clarified by a diagram: Model We can translate this description into a model, but we need to start speaking math. Variables: Let \\(x_t\\) be the fraction of people who are infected at time \\(t\\) Let \\(y_t\\) be the fraction of mosquitoes who are infected at time \\(t\\) Parameters Let \\(s\\) denote the fraction of people who remain infected after one day Let \\(p\\) denote the fraction of mosquitoes who remain alive after one day. Let \\(a\\) denote the fraction of mosquitoes who blood feed on a human Let \\(m\\) denote the number of mosquitoes per human Equations \\[\\begin{array}{rl} x_{t+1} &amp;= m a y_t (1-x_t) + s x_t \\\\ y_{t+1} &amp;= a x_t (1 - y_t) + p y_t\\\\ \\end{array}\\] This is one good place to start. "],["differential-equations.html", "2.2 Differential Equations", " 2.2 Differential Equations The second was formulated as a system of two ordinary differential equations, in the \\(2^{nd}\\) edition of The Prevention of Malaria [15]. Ross also published the same model in Nature [16] in this form: \\[ \\begin{array}{rl} dz/dt &amp;= k&#39; z&#39; (p-z) + q z \\\\ dz&#39;/dt &amp;= k z (p&#39;-z&#39;) + q&#39; z&#39; \\\\ \\end{array} \\] At the time, there was not much evidence from malaria research to frame the problem. A fully parameterized model, using biologically meaningful parameters, would have to wait for a few decades of research and a synthesis by Macdonald. If we change a few variable and parameter names (let \\(z=x\\), \\(z&#39;=y\\), \\(k&#39; = ma\\), \\(k=a\\), \\(r=e^{-s}\\), and \\(p=e^{-g}\\)), we get something that looks like the other equations: \\[ \\begin{array}{rl} dx/dt &amp;= may(1-z) - r x\\\\ dy/dt &amp;= ax(1-y) - g z \\\\ \\end{array} \\] This equation lacks an infective state for mosquitoes.
