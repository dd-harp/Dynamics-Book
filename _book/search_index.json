[["mosquito-population-dynamics.html", "2 Mosquito Population Dynamics", " 2 Mosquito Population Dynamics There are some very good reasons to care about mosquito ecology, particularly when it comes to vector control [1]. In this chapter, we fully define a model for mosquito ecology [2]. The process is actually quite simple: We define terms that describe egg-laying by adult mosquitoes; We write a basic equation that determines how eggs develop in aquatic habitats and then emerge as adults; We incorporate seasonality into parameters in an aquatic model; We replace the parameter \\(\\Lambda(t)\\) from the Aron-May model with a term that describes emergence of adults from aquatic habitats.
