# Extending Ross-Macdonald

In this chapter, we modify the Ross-Macdonald model by adding a
fully defined model for mosquito ecology. The process is actually
quite simple:

+ We define terms that describe egg-laying by adult mosquitoes; 

+ We write a basic equation that determines how eggs develop in
aquatic habitats and then emerge as adults; 

+ We incorporate seasonality into the aquatic model; 

+ We replace the parameter $\Lambda(t)$ from the Aron-May model with a term that
describes emergence of adults from aquatic habitats.
